# WANDERLUST


## Problem Statement :

Most the people have a goal or wish in life to travel different places around the world. But many times one is not able to afford to go to their dream places or even if they have money, they don't have time. But when you actucally have the money and time too, you tend to take a step back, beacuse you are scared of the unknown.

When tourists travel to different places, they are unaware of the local environment of that place which make them prone to scams, thefts, and if not this, they might not be able to enjoy the place to its fullest because they don't know what all they need to see and experience.

Tourists are often sold goods at a higher price as they don't know the original price.

## Proposed Solution :

I have created a website which displays certain places. Once a user selects a particular place, he/she gets to see which hotels are present at that place, which food items to try, what are the things one must do at that place and also helps us book hotels and flights at the cheapest price.

It also allows us to be prepared for the unknown as it gives tips about what all thighs to pack and take or do once you are in a different environment.

The app also provides some catchy quotes and also shows special offers on travel package to some places so that user can plan their holidays completely anf properly and also makes it easier for user by providing all sources and information at the smae place only.

It also consists of a comment box where user can add a comment to request for a place they want to go to and the host may take up the reuest to create a new destination package.
